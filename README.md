This project implements a multiple linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across three media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
It includes data loading, preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the regression model, making predictions, and visualizing the results with comparison plots of actual vs. predicted sales.
The goal is to understand how advertising budgets impact sales and evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy visually.
